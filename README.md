# Clicky Game

## Overview

This is a monster truck memory game with React. This application's UI is broken up into components, component state is managed throughout, and responds to user events.


### Minimum Viable Components:

1. React application that should render different images to the screen. Each image should listen for click events.

2. User score should be tracked and incremented when clicking an image for the first time. If the userclicks on an image already clicked, the score should be reset to 0.

3. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.

4. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.
